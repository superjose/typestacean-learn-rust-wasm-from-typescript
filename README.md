Typestaceans - Rust's Web Assembly Concepts for TypeScript Developers (It doesn't need to be that hard)

How you can get to speed with WASM as fast as possible as a TypeScript Developer by showcasing comparable examples between React and Yew. 

This contains a dual runnable project which allows you to see React and Yew code side by side. 


## Notes:
* Do not use this project structure as example for your Rust WASM or TypeScript project. 
* Trunk will get into an infinite loop if you have `trunk serve` running while editing `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
