Typestaceans - Rust's Web Assembly Concepts for TypeScript Developers (It doesn't need to be that hard)

How you can get to speed with WASM as fast as possible as a TypeScript Developer by showcasing comparable examples between React and Yew. 

This contains a dual runnable project which allows you to see React and Yew code side by side. 

# How to use
This project is fully bootable and can be accessed by running:
### React:
1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation). 

## Notes:
* Do not use this project structure or naming conventions as example for your Rust WASM or TypeScript project. 
* It was intentionally done to showcase the parity between the two approaches.
* Trunk will get into an infinite loop if you have `trunk serve` running while editing `.ts` and `.tsx` files.
* Folders are lowercase because rust's built-in linter warns if it doesn't follow the snake case convention. 

## Feedback is appreciated.
If you've seen there's a piece of code that we can improve, by all means!
